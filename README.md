# jarvis

Jarvis is a simple IA for home automation with voice commands written in Python. Mainly based on HomeAssistant API, the
more devices you have on HomeAssistant, the more you will be able to teach to Jarvis.

**This is only the server-side of Jarvis, you can download the client [here](https://github.com/M4TH1EU/jarvis-client)
.**

### Languages

It only supports french for now, but with some changes you should be able to use english or another language.

### Compatiblity

The server can run on anything that runs Python 3+  
The client should too **but**, the client manage the STT & TTS part and I did not found any cool voice on Linux *(for
french voices at least)* I only found out that Windows is the only one that has good french voices *(p.ex Mathieu from
IVONA2)*.
